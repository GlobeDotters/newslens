# NewsLens CLI - Next Steps

## What We've Built So Far

We've created a solid foundation for the NewsLens CLI application with the following components:

1. **Core architecture**
   - Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Data models for news sources and articles
   - News fetching from RSS feeds
   - Asynchronous fetching for improved performance
   - Analysis engine for bias detection and blindspot identification
   - Rich terminal visualization
   - Article reader mode in terminal
   - Interactive TUI with keyboard navigation and scrollable articles

2. **CLI commands**
   - `headlines` - Show top headlines with bias breakdown
   - `blindspots` - Show stories with imbalanced political coverage
   - `sources` - List and manage news sources
   - `add-source` - Add new news sources to the database
   - `remove-source` - Remove sources from the database
   - `configure` - Configure application settings
   - `countries` - List available country codes

3. **Project infrastructure**
   - Setup script for installation
   - Basic tests
   - Documentation
   - Development tools configuration

## What Needs To Be Done Next

### Short-term Improvements

1. ~~**Non-blocking interactive UI**~~ ✅
   - ~~Implement a full terminal UI with Textual~~ ✅
   - ~~Add navigation between stories and articles~~ ✅
   - ~~Make the UI responsive during data fetching~~ ✅

2. **Real-time monitoring**
   - Add daemon mode for continuous monitoring of sources
   - Implement notifications for new stories
   - Track stories as they evolve across sources

### Medium-term Features

1. **Content analysis**
   - Implement basic keyword extraction for article comparison
   - Add sentiment analysis to detect emotional tone in headlines
   - Implement headline framing comparison across sources

2. **Enhanced coverage metrics**
   - Track coverage over time to identify trends
   - Add metrics for detecting story importance
   - Implement source diversity scoring for each story

3. **Custom user profiles**
   - Allow users to mark their preferred news sources
   - Generate personalized blindspot reports based on reading habits
   - Save custom bias thresholds for blindspot detection

### Long-term Goals

1. **Community features**
   - Implement a way to share source classifications
   - Create a centralized repository for user-contributed sources
   - Build a feedback mechanism for bias ratings

2. **Advanced analysis**
   - Use NLP to improve topic clustering
   - Implement more sophisticated bias detection
   - Add historical context to ongoing stories

3. **Expanded scope**
   - Add support for more countries and languages
   - Integrate with more news aggregation APIs
   - Develop plugins for other applications

## Getting Started on Development

1. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/newslens.git
   cd newslens
   
   # Install development dependencies
   make install-dev
   ```

2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. Try out the application:
   ```bash
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   
   # Run the headlines command
   newslens headlines
   ```

4. Pick an issue from the list above and start working on it!
